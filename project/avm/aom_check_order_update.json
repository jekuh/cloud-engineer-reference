Update above definition based on  following comments:
- DefaultState not required since we are in charge of setting the update_type and it can either be tag_update or tf_update.
- There is no update_type called edge_update. update_type can only be tag_update or tf_update.
- This means we have following cases:
    - update_type = tag_update --> all edge-case updates have to be false to go straight to the update order file state
    - update_type = tf_update --> all edge-case updates have to be false to go straight to the update-order file state
    - update_type = tag_update and either account_protection_change or account_ou_change is true --> you cannot go straight to the update order file state, you need to go the edge case update path either for account-protection change or for ou-change
    - update_type = tf_update and account_name_change is true --> you cannot go straight to the update order file state, you need to go to the edge-case-update path for account-name-change
    - update_type = tf_update and account_name_change is true, and one or both of the other two edge-case updates is true as well --> you cannot go straight to the update order file state you first have to go through all edge-case updates that are set to true
- We require several AND and OR conditions to determine the next state.
- Also every edge case is also a tap_update
